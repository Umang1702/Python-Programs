# Question 1: Write a python program to add two numbers and take both number as a input from the users.
a=int(input("Enter your first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter your second number:"))
sum=a+b
print("The Addition of both numbers are: ",sum)



# Question 2:Write a python program to find the remainder when a number divided by z.
z=10
print("Remainder after divided by z is :",78/z)



# Check the type of variable assigned using input() function.
a=input()
print(type(a))




# Use comparision operator to find out whether 'a' given variable is a greater then 'b' or not.Take a=34 and b=80.
a=34 
b=80
print("a is greater than b:",a>b)




# Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
a=int(input("Enter a first number :"))
b=int(input("Enter a second number :"))
print("The Average of two numbers is :",a+b/2)





# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
a=int(input("Enter your number:"))
print("The square of a given number is :",a**2)
